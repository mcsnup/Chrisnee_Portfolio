                            <p>An Important lesson to learn in this
                                present life is Thanksgiving- Giving Thanks to God.
                                For most persons, and that very much includes myself,
                                Giving Thanks is not the first thing we remember,
                                especially in the most unfortunate and difficult of circumstances.
                                We tend to think of Thanksgiving as some religious festivals at
                                worst and some thing to do when you’re having the best of days.
                                However, the Bible teaches so clearly that: <br>
                                <font>“In every thing
                                    give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ
                                    Jesus concerning you.”</font> <b>(1 Thessalonians 5:18).</b><br>
                            </p>
                            <p class="article"> Of course very strictly speaking, only the Holy Spirit can produce
                                this kind of Thanksgiving in the heart of any Man. Yes,
                                religiously we can all attempt to by our soul-life fake a
                                thanks in all things (though, a very hard thing) disposition,
                                however, there is a “finally I made it through the Storm…”
                                And that there, cannot be faked, because,
                                it is beyond the words of Music, and not everybody makes
                                it through the Storm! The Storm as I Understand it,
                                is not the challenges and obstacles or difficulties of
                                present material life… No, this is only a transient storm,
                                the true storm is the soul or self life,
                                that which Christ says to deny by taking up the cross!
                                The purpose of today’s good, bad, beautiful and ugly,
                                is the blessed hope of being with the Lord Jesus Christ forever,
                                it is strictly the redeemed heart that sings during the storm:
                                “my soul bless the Lord…” that may sing Praise Him in the Final Hour-
                                the day of His Appearing.
