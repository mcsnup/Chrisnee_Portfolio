        Verse

        Thank you for the life you gave to me
        Thank you for the work you have done
        Enemies arise you made me defeat 
        If not for you Onye eah Onye eah
        God of plenty give me plenty 
        When all I’ve lived for is gone yeah
        You’ve given joy and victory 
        Right now, tribulation is far from
        <br> <br> <br>
        Pre-chorus 
        That’s the reason why I say
        You gave the greatest gift of all
        Christ the only son
        You deserve all of me
        <br> <br> <br>

        Verse
        You’ve lifted me from grass to grace
        You cloth me with your grace I can’t be disgrace hmmm
        You picked me from zero and made me a hero
        If not for you , Onye eah Onye eah
        You’ve taken away all the mystery 
        Defended me when I’m oppressed 
        So many blessings that I could not see
        You’ve been blessing me now I live in bliss
        <br><br><br>
        Pre-chorus

        Bridge 
        <br><br><br>
        I can see
        The Rising of my sun
        After the rain, comes my sunshine 
        When the ranging storm 
        Darkened my sun 
        I can see the light 
        Is my dawning of a new day
        <br><br><br>
        There’s no one like you
        No one like you  8x
        <br><br><br>
        That’s the reason why I say 
        You gave the greatest gift of all 
        Christ the only son 
        You deserve all me
        <br><br><br>
        Onye eah… Onye eah Onye eah
        Odiri Onye  diri Onye
        Onye eah… Onye eah Onye eah
        <br><br><br>
        Thank you Jesus!
